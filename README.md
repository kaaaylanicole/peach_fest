My 2021 Code Louisville project is my "fake" dream music festival lineup called Peach Fest. 
I have built my website for mobile responsiveness and included 2 media queries (1 for Tablet and 1 for Desktop)

For my required CSS features, I have included:
- A "navigation" menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes. My days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) start stacking from tablet to mobile.
- Use Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. The two "headliners" on every day move around based on the size of the screen.

For my required Javascript features, I have included:
- A Contact Us form at the bottom of the page when clicking "Buy Tickets." The form asks for your email to receive more info about Peach Fest.
- Hide / Show one or more content areas through clicking a button. This is shown by toggling between the days and switching the lineup per day, as well as hiding and showing the contact form by clicking the button & the 'X' to close out.
